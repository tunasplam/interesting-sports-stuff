# Interesting Sports Stuff

I often wonder about things in baseball. Sometimes, I actually try and answer those questions. This git repo is dedicated to collecting my musings about sports.

## Questions for the Future

### 0 AB but PA > 0?
There are several entries in the batting table (~200) which have 0 AB yet a PA value greater than 0. I am sure this is a quirk in the definitions of each stat but right now it feels like too much of a tangent.


### griffal01 - Alfredo Griffin (1976-1993) Deepdive

He had horrifying bWAR stats. One of the worst of all time. But he had a lengthy career across several teams and earned a couple of accolades. He was a defensive-minded SS, but did he actually contribute to his teams or was he a liability? Is he an example of a player where WAR does not do them justice? To help answer these questions, we should look at his fWAR and oWAR each season compared to other players at SS across the league in the same season. Also look at various other metrics such as baserunning.

### Embarassing Baseball Games

There are many different definitions of "embarassing bsaeball games. But what about box scores like this?

R H E
8 2 0

What the heck did the other team do to give the opponent a boxscore like that??

Note that a boxscore like
R H E
8 7 0

can have some H's removed if those H's ended up doing nothing in that inning. But games without having those treatments with these weird boxscores are especially special.

The goal: Find the most embarrassing baseball games by ratio of R to H (high values of R/H and relatively low E's). I bet we could find some real amazing stuff in those games.

As a bonus, create an animation by showing the line charts for each at bat. Compare that of the embarrassing games (for the winning team) versus those of 100 randomly sampled games. We should see not many hits but lots of baserunners and scoring!
